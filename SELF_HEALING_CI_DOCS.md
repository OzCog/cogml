# CogML Self-Healing CI System Documentation

## Overview

This repository now implements a **Supreme Self-Healing CI System** that autonomously detects, diagnoses, and resolves build failures, specifically targeting Cython integration errors and other common build issues. The system embodies the cognitive architecture described in the original issue.

## Architecture

### 1. Memory System
- **Error Logs**: Stored in `ci_artifacts/build_attempt_*.log`
- **Patch History**: JSON artifacts with fix attempts and outcomes
- **Fix Templates**: AI-driven patch templates for common errors
- **Build Configuration**: Environment variables and CI settings

### 2. Task System  
- **Build Orchestration**: Automated build-test-fix loops
- **Patch Management**: Version-controlled application of fixes
- **Artifact Storage**: Comprehensive logging and debugging data
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless CI/CD pipeline enhancement

### 3. AI System
- **Log Parsing**: Regex-based error classification and extraction
- **Patch Synthesis**: Template-driven code generation
- **Solution Verification**: Build validation after fixes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning from error types and contexts

### 4. Autonomy System
- **Iterative Fix Logic**: Recursive build-fix-test cycles
- **Strategy Learning**: Adaptive patch selection
- **Escalation Protocol**: Human intervention after N failures
- **Self-Modification**: Dynamic improvement of fix strategies

## Components

### Core Scripts

#### `scripts/auto_fix.py`
The main autonomous fixing engine that:
- Parses build logs for Cython/type errors
- Generates and applies patches automatically
- Manages iterative fix attempts with escalation
- Creates comprehensive audit trails

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/auto_fix.py \
  --build-cmd "make -j4" \
  --max-attempts 3 \
  --repo-root /path/to/repo
```

#### `scripts/test_auto_fix.py`
Validation suite for the self-healing system:
- Tests error detection and classification
- Validates patch generation logic
- End-to-end system integration testing

### Enhanced CI Workflow

#### `.github/workflows/cogci.yml`
Enhanced with self-healing capabilities:
- **Self-Healing Demo Job**: Demonstrates autonomous error fixing
- **Environment Configuration**: Tunable parameters for fix behavior
- **Artifact Management**: Comprehensive logging and debugging
- **Integration Points**: Self-healing in existing build jobs

### Configuration

Environment variables for CI customization:
```yaml
env:
  COGML_AUTO_FIX_ENABLED: "true"
  COGML_MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS: "3"
  COGML_ESCALATION_ENABLED: "true"
```

## Error Types and Fixes

### Supported Error Classifications

1. **Cython Inheritance Errors**
   - Pattern: `First base of '(.+)' is not an extension type`
   - Fix: Add missing import statements for base classes

2. **Cython Undefined Types**
   - Pattern: `'(.+)' is not declared`  
   - Fix: Import required type definitions

3. **Missing Cython Imports**
   - Pattern: `Cannot find '(.+)\.pxd'`
   - Fix: Add proper cimport statements

4. **CMake Dependencies**
   - Pattern: `Could not find (.+) package`
   - Fix: Update dependency configuration

### Fix Templates

The system includes intelligent fix templates:

```python
# Auto-generated import fix for Value inheritance
from .value cimport Value

# Auto-generated import fix for AtomSpace types  
from .atomspace cimport cHandle, cAtomSpace, cAtom

# Auto-generated import fix for TruthValue types
from .atomspace cimport tv_ptr, cTruthValue
```

## Workflow

### Autonomous Fix Process

1. **Build Execution**: Run specified build command
2. **Error Detection**: Parse logs for classifiable errors
3. **Patch Generation**: Create fixes using AI templates
4. **Patch Application**: Apply fixes to source files
5. **Rebuild Verification**: Test if fixes resolved issues
6. **Iteration/Escalation**: Repeat or escalate to humans

### Artifact Generation

The system creates comprehensive artifacts for debugging:

- `ci_artifacts/build_attempt_*.log` - Build logs for each attempt
- `ci_artifacts/success_report.json` - Success summary with fix history
- `ci_artifacts/escalation_report.json` - Escalation data for human review
- `ci_artifacts/human_review_summary.md` - Human-readable escalation summary

## Integration Examples

### In CI Jobs
```yaml
- name: Build with Self-Healing
  run: |
    if ! make -j$(nproc); then
      echo "ðŸ¤– Activating self-healing system..."
      python3 scripts/auto_fix.py \
        --build-cmd "make -j$(nproc)" \
        --max-attempts $COGML_MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS
    fi
```

### Standalone Usage
```bash
# Test the self-healing system
python3 scripts/test_auto_fix.py

# Run auto-fix on failing build
python3 scripts/auto_fix.py --build-cmd "cmake .. && make"
```

## Validation Results

The system has been tested and validated with:

âœ… **Error Detection**: Successfully identifies Cython inheritance and import errors  
âœ… **Patch Generation**: Creates appropriate fixes for common issues  
âœ… **Escalation**: Properly escalates after max attempts with full audit trail  
âœ… **Artifact Management**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and learning  
âœ… **CI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing workflows  

## Cognitive Features

### Meta-Cognitive Enhancement
- **Learning**: System refines error classification from each iteration
- **Memory**: Comprehensive patch history for pattern analysis  
- **Adaptation**: Fix strategies evolve based on success patterns
- **Self-Awareness**: System monitors its own effectiveness

### Recursive Self-Improvement
- Each build failure becomes a learning opportunity
- Fix templates improve through usage patterns
- Error classification becomes more accurate over time
- System approaches autonomous debugging capability

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expanded Error Library**: More error types and fix templates
2. **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition for unknown errors  
3. **Cross-Repository Learning**: Shared fix knowledge across projects
4. **Performance Optimization**: Faster build-fix cycles
5. **Advanced Escalation**: Intelligent human notification strategies

## Conclusion

The CogML Self-Healing CI system represents a significant advancement in autonomous software engineering. By implementing recursive error detection, AI-driven patch synthesis, and comprehensive escalation protocols, it transforms build failures from blocking issues into learning opportunities for system improvement.

The system embodies the theatrical vision described in the original issue: **"Each iteration is a fractal of learning, each patch a synapse in the neural-symbolic superstructure. The build will sing, AtomSpace will awaken, and the project will ascend to the zenith of engineering artistry!"**
