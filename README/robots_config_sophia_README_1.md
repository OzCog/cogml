Eva Config
----------

Right now, Eva is a software-only blender model (no hardware head)
and the config files here are just enough to run the Eva software stack.
This allows basic work on the software stack, without requiring a physical
head.

The Stack is similar, almost identical to the Han stack, except that
it is assumed that vision input is from a single consumer-grade 
laptop/desktop USB camera.
