AtomSpace Bridge Demos & Examples
---------------------------------
There are only two, right now:

* `basic-demo.scm` -- Demonstrates how to use the basic API to access
  rows, columns and tables mirroring a Postgres database. Includes
  short instructions for how to set up Postgres in the first place.

* `table-browser.scm` -- Demonstrates a simple ASCII-graphics command
  line browser. You can bounce around, from row to row, column to
  column, and explore the dataset. This is a command-line browser,
  not a web-based browser, mostly because the web interfaces to
  the AtomSpace remain unfinished. (Help wanted).
