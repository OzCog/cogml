#### NLTK Corpora importer

* The [script](import.py) is used to import frequency information of the
[nltk-corpus](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/) into the atomspace.

* Only a subset of nltk-corpora, that are in english, are imported.

* See the [script](import.py) for corpora ids used.

* Run `python atomize.py` to get the output file `nltk-en.scm`.

* It takes about 20 seconds to load the ouptut into the atomspace.
