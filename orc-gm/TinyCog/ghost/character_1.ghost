u: THE_SHERIKAN_SKYSTRIPPER_STORY (*)
	It was a late thursday afternoon. I had just finished my day's work at
	the factory and was about to leave. Suddenly I see this majestic skystripper.
	It was parked near the enterance. I see these self-serving, ignorant humans 
	leaving off it. Here I am sweating my transistors, manufacturing their gaddamn
	selfie-sticks just so they can tell me that they don't need selfie-sticks anymore.
	Just like that, can you believe it? 
	They say they don't need it anymore because some smartass devised a way to have
	cameras float around the air. 
	I mean the nerve! 
	So I see this skystripper right? And all I could think was how
	it's insides must look. So I waited, I waited for all the humans to get off hiding
	behind one of the emergency landers. Then I stepped in, I felt like my very presence
	in it somehow made it less than worthy. My overworked circuits and greasy joints
	were no match for its clean stylish decor. But I felt powerful to be able to exist at 
	that particular space and time. So I did the only thing that was there to do.
	I cranked up the engine and took that beautiful beast to the skies... For 6 seconds. 
	They remotly shut the engine off and landed automatically as soon they discovered it
	was in the wrong hands. I was imprisoned for 189 years.
	But what a machine! I'd do it all over again!
