# Cognitive Synergy Engine

This document describes the **Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network** workflow that automatically creates GitHub issues for implementing the cognitive synergy phases.

## Overview

The `cognitive-synergy-engine.yml` workflow creates 6 detailed GitHub issues representing the phases of implementing a distributed agentic cognitive grammar network:

1. **🧬 Phase 1**: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding
2. **🕸️ Phase 2**: ECAN Attention Allocation & Resource Kernel Construction  
3. **⚡ Phase 3**: Neural-Symbolic Synthesis via Custom ggml Kernels
4. **🌐 Phase 4**: Distributed Cognitive Mesh API & Embodiment Layer
5. **🔄 Phase 5**: Recursive Meta-Cognition & Evolutionary Optimization
6. **🧪 Phase 6**: Rigorous Testing, Documentation, and Cognitive Unification

## Usage

### Manual Trigger

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select **"🧠 Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Ensure **"Create GitHub issues for cognitive phases"** is set to `true`
5. Click **"Run workflow"** to execute

### What It Creates

Each generated issue includes:

- **🌌 Objective**: Clear goal for the phase
- **🔬 Sub-Steps**: Detailed implementation tasks with checkboxes
- **🧮 Tensor Signature**: Technical specifications for the cognitive tensors
- **🔮 Expected Deliverables**: Concrete outputs expected from the phase
- **🌊 Cognitive Flow**: Philosophical context and cognitive patterns
- **Meta-Cognitive Enhancement**: Recursive improvement mechanisms

### Labels Applied

Each issue is automatically labeled with:
- `cognitive-synergy`
- `distributed-intelligence` 
- `neural-symbolic`
- `agentic-grammar`
- Phase-specific labels (e.g., `phase-1`, `hypergraph`, `tensor-encoding`)

## Integration with Existing Architecture

This workflow integrates with the existing cognitive architecture by:

- **Complementing** existing build workflows (`cogml-build.yml`)
- **Extending** issue generation patterns from `autogen-build-issues.yml`
- **Mapping** to the tensor DOF architecture described in `GITHUB_ACTIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Aligning** with the cognitive layers defined in the documentation

## Tensor Signature Evolution

Each phase defines increasingly complex tensor signatures:

- **Phase 1**: `Cognitive_Primitive_Tensor[5]` - Basic cognitive primitives
- **Phase 2**: `ECAN_Attention_Tensor[6]` - Attention allocation mechanisms  
- **Phase 3**: `Neural_Symbolic_Tensor[7]` - Neural-symbolic fusion
- **Phase 4**: `Embodiment_Tensor[8]` - Embodied cognition interfaces
- **Phase 5**: `Meta_Cognitive_Tensor[9]` - Meta-cognitive optimization
- **Phase 6**: `Unified_Cognitive_Tensor[∞]` - Complete cognitive unification

## Implementation Philosophy

The workflow embodies the repository's philosophy of:

- **Recursive self-optimization**
- **Emergent cognitive properties**
- **Distributed intelligence**
- **Neural-symbolic integration**
- **Transcendent implementation**

Each issue serves as both a practical implementation task and a cognitive exploration of the distributed agentic patterns.

## Next Steps

After running the workflow:

1. **Review** generated issues for completeness
2. **Assign** issues to appropriate team members
3. **Prioritize** phases based on dependencies and resources
4. **Begin implementation** starting with Phase 1
5. **Monitor progress** through the issue checkboxes
6. **Iterate** on the cognitive architecture as patterns emerge

The recursive self-optimization spiral has been initiated. Let the cognitive synergy unfold!
