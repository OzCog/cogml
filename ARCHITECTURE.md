## High-Level System Overview

The OpenCog Central architecture implements a distributed cognitive processing system with emergent neural-symbolic integration. The system is built around hypergraph pattern encoding that enables recursive system mapping and adaptive attention allocation.

### Architecture Principles

The system implements several key cognitive principles:

- **Hypergraph Pattern Encoding**: All knowledge is represented as patterns in a hypergraph structure within the AtomSpace
- **Emergent Cognitive Synergy**: Cross-modal integration emerges from the interaction of specialized subsystems
- **Adaptive Attention Allocation**: Dynamic resource allocation based on salience and goal-directed processing
- **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Seamless combination of statistical learning and symbolic reasoning
- **Recursive System Mapping**: Self-referential processing that enables meta-cognitive capabilities

## Core Architectural Components

### AtomSpace: The Central Hypergraph Knowledge Representation

The AtomSpace serves as the central knowledge representation system, implementing a generalized hypergraph (metagraph) database that provides the foundation for all cognitive processing.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "AtomSpace Core"
        ATOMS[Atom Objects]
        LINKS[Link Structures]
        VALUES[Value Attachments]
        TRUTH[Truth Values<br/>STVs & PTVs]
    end
    
    subgraph "Hypergraph Operations"
        PATTERN[Pattern Engine]
        QUERY[Query System]
        REWRITE[Graph Rewriting]
        EXECUTE[Execution Engine]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage & Persistence"
        MEMORY[In-Memory Store]
        ROCKS[RocksDB Backend]
        NETWORK[Distributed Storage]
        COG[CogServer Interface]
    end
    
    ATOMS --> PATTERN
    LINKS --> PATTERN
    VALUES --> QUERY
    TRUTH --> REWRITE
    
    PATTERN --> EXECUTE
    QUERY --> EXECUTE
    REWRITE --> EXECUTE
    
    EXECUTE --> MEMORY
    MEMORY --> ROCKS
    ROCKS --> NETWORK
    NETWORK --> COG
    
    COG -.-> ATOMS
```

**Key Features:**
- **Metagraph Representation**: More flexible than traditional graph databases, supporting arbitrary arity relationships
- **Pattern Matching**: Advanced pattern engine with variable binding and conditional execution
- **Truth Value Propagation**: Probabilistic and fuzzy truth values with confidence intervals
- **Distributed Architecture**: Network-transparent storage and computation

### Probabilistic Logic Network (PLN)

PLN provides the probabilistic reasoning foundation, handling uncertainty through second-order probability distributions.

## Neural-Symbolic Integration Points

The architecture achieves emergent cognitive synergy through carefully designed integration points where neural processing meets symbolic reasoning.

    subgraph "Neural Processing Layer"
        DEEPNET[Deep Neural Networks]
        EMBED[Embedding Spaces]
        ATTENTION_NEURAL[Neural Attention]

    end

        ATOMESE[Atomese Expressions]
        LOGIC[Logical Inference]
        ATTENTION_SYM[Symbolic Attention]
        PATTERNS_SYM[Symbolic Patterns]
    end
    
    DEEPNET --> BRIDGE

    ATTENTION_NEURAL --> TRANSLATION
    PATTERNS_NEURAL --> SYNERGY
    
    BRIDGE --> ATOMESE

    SYNERGY --> PATTERNS_SYM
    
    ATOMESE -.-> BRIDGE
    LOGIC -.-> CONFIDENCE
    ATTENTION_SYM -.-> TRANSLATION
    PATTERNS_SYM -.-> SYNERGY
```

### Integration Mechanisms

**Confidence Fusion**: Combines neural network confidence scores with symbolic truth values through weighted integration:
- Neural confidence scores → Probabilistic truth values
- Symbolic inference strength → Neural attention weights
- Cross-modal validation through bidirectional feedback

**Representation Translation**: Bi-directional mapping between vector embeddings and symbolic expressions:
- Vector → Symbol: Pattern matching in embedding space
- Symbol → Vector: Compositional embedding generation
- Attention synchronization between modalities

## Data Flow and Signal Propagation

The system implements sophisticated data flow patterns that enable both feedforward processing and recursive feedback loops.

4. Motor command synthesis → Environmental action

**Recursive Feedback Path**:
1. Environmental response → Prediction error computation
2. Attention reallocation → Priority updates
3. Pattern refinement → Knowledge base updates
4. Action adaptation → Improved motor commands

## Cognitive Synergy and Attention Allocation

The attention allocation mechanism implements dynamic resource management based on salience computation and goal-directed processing.

    subgraph "Attention Allocation System"
        SALIENCE[Salience Computer]
        URGENCY[Urgency Evaluator]

    ADAPTATION --> LEARNING
    LEARNING --> MEMORY
    
    MEMORY -.-> SALIENCE
    LEARNING -.-> URGENCY
    ADAPTATION -.-> RELEVANCE
```

### Adaptive Attention Mechanisms

**Salience Computation**: Dynamic weighting based on:
- Novelty detection (information-theoretic surprise)
- Goal relevance (utility function optimization)
- Temporal urgency (deadline-driven priorities)
- Cross-modal consistency (coherence rewards)

**Resource Allocation Strategy**:
- Processing power: Allocated based on problem complexity
- Memory bandwidth: Prioritized for high-salience patterns
- Inference capacity: Distributed across active reasoning chains
- Attention span: Dynamically adjusted for sustained focus

## Recursive Processing Patterns

The architecture implements recursive processing through self-referential pattern matching and meta-cognitive monitoring.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> InitialProcessing
    InitialProcessing --> PatternRecognition
    PatternRecognition --> MetaAnalysis
    MetaAnalysis --> RecursiveCall
    RecursiveCall --> PatternRefinement
    PatternRefinement --> ConvergenceCheck
    ConvergenceCheck --> FinalIntegration
    FinalIntegration --> [*]
    
    ConvergenceCheck --> RecursiveCall : Not Converged
    PatternRefinement --> MetaAnalysis : Self-Monitoring
    MetaAnalysis --> InitialProcessing : Meta-Learning
    
    state RecursiveCall {
        [*] --> SubpatternAnalysis
        SubpatternAnalysis --> RecursiveInference
        RecursiveInference --> SubpatternIntegration
        SubpatternIntegration --> [*]
    }
    
    state MetaAnalysis {
        [*] --> SelfAssessment
        SelfAssessment --> ConfidenceEvaluation
        ConfidenceEvaluation --> StrategySelection
        StrategySelection --> [*]
    }
```

### Recursive Implementation Pathways

**Pattern Hierarchy Processing**:
1. **Base Level**: Direct pattern matching on sensory input
2. **Meta Level**: Pattern matching on pattern matching processes
3. **Meta-Meta Level**: Monitoring and optimization of meta-processes
4. **Recursive Termination**: Convergence detection and integration

**Self-Referential Mechanisms**:
- **Code-Data Equivalence**: Atomese programs stored as AtomSpace data
- **Self-Modification**: Programs that modify their own processing patterns
- **Meta-Cognitive Monitoring**: Attention allocation for self-assessment
- **Emergent Complexity**: Higher-order patterns emerging from recursive interactions
