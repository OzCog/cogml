Notes
=====
The ng2-atomspace-visualizer directory contains a copy of the
original visualizer code, copied from npm

https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-atomspace-visualizer/v/1.3.9

Why is there a copy? Because, as of right now, the original git
repo has been lost. The original git repo is supposed to be at

https://gitlab.com/icog-labs/atomspace-visualizer

but it currently gives a "404 Not Found" error. This is a problem.
If the git repo is ever found again, then, yes, the 
`ng2-atomspace-visualizer` directory can be removed.
