# Logic Layer: Tensor Dimensions Documentation

## LogicTensorDOF Structure (64 Dimensions)

### Truth Propagation (Dimensions 0-15)
- **Purpose**: Track how truth values propagate through reasoning chains
- **Range**: [0.0, 1.0] representing truth strength
- **Operations**: Combined via element-wise operations in logical operators

### Inference Strength (Dimensions 16-31)  
- **Purpose**: Measure the strength of inferential connections
- **Range**: [0.0, 1.0] representing inference confidence
- **Operations**: Used in pattern matching and rule application

### Logical Consistency (Dimensions 32-47)
- **Purpose**: Track consistency of logical relationships
- **Range**: [0.0, 1.0] representing consistency measure
- **Operations**: Validated during knowledge graph integrity checks

### Reasoning Confidence (Dimensions 48-63)
- **Purpose**: Overall confidence in reasoning results
- **Range**: [0.0, 1.0] representing confidence level
- **Operations**: Used for thresholding and result ranking

## Tensor Operations

### Logical AND (`&&`)
```cpp
result.dimension[i] = std::min(tensor_a.dimension[i], tensor_b.dimension[i]);
```

### Logical OR (`||`)
```cpp
result.dimension[i] = std::max(tensor_a.dimension[i], tensor_b.dimension[i]);
```

### Logical NOT (`!`)
```cpp
result.dimension[i] = 1.0f - tensor.dimension[i];
```

### Logical IMPLIES (`->`)
```cpp
result = (!antecedent) || consequent;
```

## Integration with Hypergraph Foundation

The Logic Layer tensor dimensions integrate with the existing hypergraph foundation:
- **Spatial (3D)**: Node positioning in concept space
- **Temporal (1D)**: Time-based reasoning evolution
- **Semantic (256D)**: Concept embeddings and similarity
- **Logical (64D)**: Reasoning operations and inference
