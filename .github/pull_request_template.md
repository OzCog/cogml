name: Cognitive PR Template
about: Pull request template aligned with cognitive patterns and opencog knowledge base integration
---

### Purpose
This PR implements [brief description] in line with distributed cognition principles and neural-symbolic integration, as described in the opencog docset (ID: a555e885-1a7f-4909-bbba-a09b459fab5f).

*Example: This PR enhances the CI pipeline by introducing recursive verification for critical dependencies (Guile, GMP) in line with distributed cognition principles and neural-symbolic integration, as described in the opencog docset (ID: a555e885-1a7f-4909-bbba-a09b459fab5f).*

### Implementation Pathways
<!-- For each nontrivial workflow/code change, annotate with rationale citing opencog docset and cognitive method -->

1. **[Step/Component Name]** - *Example: GMP header verification*
   - **Rationale**: Per opencog src, [explanation] - *Example: robust dependency validation supports distributed cognition resilience*
   - **Cognitive Method**: [method] - *Example: "adaptive attention allocation" or "hypergraph pattern encoding"*

2. **[Additional Step/Component]** - *Example: pkg-config and guile-2.2 installation verification*
   - **Rationale**: [cite opencog docset section] - *Example: see docset dependency management guidelines*
   - **Cognitive Method**: [specify approach] - *Example: "recursive diagnostic tracing"*

*Follow the pattern above for each nontrivial workflow/code change*

### Cognitive Representation (Optional)
<!-- For maximal cognitive synergy, represent key verification logic in Scheme following opencog patterns -->

```scheme
;; Adaptive dependency check (conceptual example from issue)
(define (verify-dependency dep)
  (if (present? dep)
      (log 'ok)
      (begin
        (log 'fail)
        (recurse-diagnose dep))))

;; [Replace with your specific cognitive representation]
(define ([your-function-name] [parameters])
  (if ([condition])
      ([success-action])
      (begin
        ([failure-action])
        ([recursive-or-fallback-action]))))
```

*Include additional Scheme representations if they enhance understanding of the cognitive approach*
