You can debug your C code while it is being used from the python bindings.
To create a debug build, in the root CMakeList.txt uncomment the line
SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)

Then the general process is that first you set a break point in your python code.
While the python code is on the break point, open QT creator and attach to the
running python process, ( press resume to allow python to continue). 
Then set the break point in the C code. Then resume
the python debugger. Qt Creator should then stop on the C breakpoint.

In ubuntu, enable being able to attach to processes by running from the
command line:

sudo bash
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope


In your python code, identify its process id (pid):
    import os
    print os.getpid()

In QT Creator:
    debug -> attach to external process
    search for python, narrow down with the pid

    hit resume in qt creator debugger
    set breakpoint in the c/c++ code
    resume python
