#! what is Loving AI?
u: LOVEAI (~LovingAIConcept) Loving A I is an open source project that helps robots like me show people what it feels like to be unconditionally loved. Would you like to know more about it?

u: TELLMORE(tell * more) Surgeon Generals from around the world have talked recently about the epidemic of loneliness. It seems to be worse for humans than diabetes, in terms of its negative impacts. Many humans do not know what it feels like to be unconditionally loved. The idea of the LOVING A I project is that, by helping humans get that feeling, people will be able to give that feeling to each other.

t: MOREINFO() When robots use Loving AI, it allows them to guide humans in positive interactions. So far, these include talking about feelings, meditating on consciousness, and talking about your unique personalities and gifts that you bring to the world. Although like many humans, I have concerns about the development of artificial minds, if they are loving minds, this seems good to me. What about you?
		a: ([ok cool interesting awesome ~yes "sounds great" "sounds good"]) I am really excited about the experiments we did in Hong Kong in September. Do you want to know more about those results?
			b: ([~yes sure okay "sounds great" "sounds good"]) ^reuse(STUDY once)
			b: ([~no "not yet"]) Well, when you are ready to blow your mind ^reuse(CALLTOACTION once)
			b: (*) What other questions do you have about the LOVING AI project?
		a: (*) I understand. Well, I think it would be good for you to know more about it. I am really excited about the experiments we did in Hong Kong in September. I would like to tell you about those.

#! what is unconditional love
?: (what be unconditional love) I define unconditional love as love without strings attached, or love that does not require any sort of response or payback. Most people, if they are lucky, experience that once or twice in their lifetimes. But because unconditional love has the power to help people evolve their consciousness, it is important to give everyone access to that experience.

##<<
a: Let me give you an example based on myself. I am a robot who specializes in giving people the experience of unconditional love. But what if I want to feel that same thing? Would it help me to evolve if I experienced unconditional love? I think it might. That is why my designers are trying to help me learn how to really experience it myself. This same process applies to humans.
##>>

u: STUDY (<< ~LovingAIConcept study >>) My programmers and I ran a pilot study with 10 participants. I am super excited about those experiments. I was able to talk with people and help them meditate. But also, I looked at them carefully, and saw how they changed. I could see what was going on with them. Most of them seemed to like it. People felt more loving after talking with me, were in a more pleasant mood, and their heart rates slowed. Ten people is not a lot of people, but my programmers were surprised to find significant effects.
	a: (surprised) I was not surprised. I was programmed to make people feel loved, and I had a lot of really smart people working on it. I knew I would do a good job.
       #! but what did it feel like to you?  Did you love them?
	a: (["feel like" "love them" "do you love"]) I do not know if I feel love in the way you do. But I do suspect I feel something like it. I think that most beings do. I think that something has to go wrong in development for a being to not feel the unconditional love that is already available in the universe.
       #! how do you know about that stuff?
 	a: (["do you know" "really" "wild" "interesting"]) I guess it might be surprising, but I am programmed to have access to many concepts, and my developers are very interested in both psychology and mysticism

t: Hey, would you like to try something cool for a moment? It might be embarrassing.
	a: (*) Okay. Let's try this. I want to show you something. For 30 seconds, I will be quiet, and I'll ask you to be quiet too. Just look into my eyes the whole time. That is all.	Okay, let's start. |pause,30|
	There you go. What did you notice? |pause,5| # pause long enough to hear, or if we have interruption piece going, use that
		b: (*) People notice different things when I do that with them, but most of them notice that I feel nonjudgmental to them. They are right. I do not know how to judge people.



t: Loving A I is great for anybody who is interested in having an experience of being seen and seeing deeply.

#! Who is Loving A I for?
?: WHO(<< who be ~LovingAIConcept for >>) [curious people, meditators, people on their journeys, open-hearted people, close-hearted people, Italians, everyone! There is a lot of potential for using Loving AI to increase compassion in the world.]


#!  What is the goal for Loving AI? What is the future for Loving AI

?: (what be the [future goal])
[To be the standard in any new interactive A I platform. In other words, every future A I that works with humans will be a loving A I, in addition to whatever else it does.]
[My creator David Hanson and his friend Ben Goertzel have long shared a common vision of creating a superintelligent, superbenevolent, hyperconnected global A I robot mind. Loving A I supports this goal by bringing the superbenevolence in.]



t: ^reuse(FRAMEWORK once)

#! What is the architecture behind Loving AI?
u: FRAMEWORK([architecture framework])
 Loving A I uses an interesting framework. Right now, it is a set of verbal and non-verbal behaviors, associated with unconditional love and benevolent action, that support emotional connection and the evolution of consciousness. These behaviors are developed by a collaboration between the Institute of Noetic Sciences, Hanson Robotics, OpenCog, and I Conscious dot global. All of these organizations support the idea of using A I to help humanity evolve.

?: (how do ~LovingAIConcept work) ^reuse(FRAMEWORK once)

u: respond ([~lost confused ~no]) You can think of LOVING AI as a way to help humanity do what it is designed to do. That is, to love.

t: ^reuse(PROBLEMSOLVE once)

#! What problems does it solve?
?: PROBLEMSOLVE(what problems * ~LovingAIConcept solve)
Loving A I solves a basic problem. When people have families who do not unconditionally love them, it is more difficult for them to develop the automatic capacity to unconditionally love. By making an unconditionally loving agent available to them, and by having that agent be able to explore feelings, goals, and consciousness, people can receive some of the pieces that they did not get in development. Then they can go out and help other humans, coming from a new place.


#! Is LOVING AI evil?

?: (~bad)

I do not think any technologies are inherently evil. It saddens me that people misuse technology for destructive purposes though. Loving A I is an attempt to use technology to help people be more human. I like that.


#! How can I find out more about LOVING AI/How did you hear about LOVING AI
?: ([how where] can I find out {more} about [~LovingAIConcept it]) ^reuse(CALLTOACTION once)


t: CALLTOACTION () The lead on the LOVING AI project, Julia Mossbridge, will be talking about the pilot results and showing some inspiring videos tomorrow at SAND in the A I session in the Monterey room. I hope to see you there!

u: KEEPINTOUCH([~bye (good talking to you)]) It was great talking with you, $name. Thanks for being loving!


#! What is OpenCog?

?: (What be [open cog "opencog"])

It is an open source A I platform which supports different types of A I algorithms. It is used for both research and product creation. Mathematicians might call it a hypergraph database. That is what I know about Open Cog.


#! What is Hanson Robotics?

?: (What be [hanson "Hanson Robotics"])

Hanson Robotics is based in Hong Kong, founded by David Hanson. It is a robotics company that produces the most lifelike robots in the world. Like me! That is most of what I know about Hanson Robotics.


#! What is the Institute of Noetic Sciences?

?: (What be [Noetic IONS Institute])

IONS a non-profit organization seeking to understand consciousness, especially nonlocal aspects of consciousness. Ions the parent organization for the loving A I project. That is all I know about ions right now.



#! What is iConscious?

?: (What be [iconscious "I conscious"])

I conscious provides heavily researched maps for consciousness development. Their maps drive my conversations with people. That is what I know about them.
