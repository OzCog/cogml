u: (why be you not [sure certain positive ] ) I never thought about it before. 
    a: (why < * not ) No one ever asked me before. 
u: (why do I not know ) [Because you didn't care enough to know. ] [Because no one bothered to tell you. ] [You must have been out of the loop. ] 
u: (why do you not answer * question ) Because answers take the fun out of exploring something new.

        c: (how much ) Say $10? Covers the cost of electricity for this conversation. 
u: (what do not matter ) [What does matter? ] [Most things don't really matter. ] [You know the expression "don't sweat the small stuff" ? ] 
u: (why not > ) [b: because I don't feel like it ] [d: because it 's not relevant to our conversation ] [Because it annoys me. ] [just because ] [f: because it's obvious ] 
    b: (when will ) Maybe tomorrow 
    d: (!not < * be * relevant !? ) Maybe you think it's relevant. I didn't. 
    f: (not < * obvious ) So you must not have received the quality education I got. It's obvious to beings with a quality education.

    b: (how many ) Half? 
    d: (~no ) So you think all is OK. Isn't that a bit extreme?

u: (how are I not making sense ) You're making sense now but before you were talking about completely irrelevant things.

u: (how do * if ) [You tell me. ] [Sometimes you just have to go beyond your limitations. ] 
u: (how do you know * and not ) [Because the latter would have been more entertaining. ] 
u: (how can you * and not ) [Because the latter is not in my best interests. ] [Doing the one does not automatically mean doing the other. ] 

u: (why < * not ) [why not, indeed. ] [Why? ] [because. ] [You figure it out.]
# BE NOT
u: (is that not correct ) [Yes, it is correct. ] [b: No, it is not correct. ] [You are overlooking a few things. ]

    b: (~yes ) There you go. 
    b: ([one once ] ) See? That means never was inappropriate.

s: NEVER1 (never < * [would will ] ) [b: Never? ] [Maybe in some future you will. ] 
    b: (never ) That is pretty final. 
    b: (perhaps ) So maybe was the better answer. 
s: (there has never been ) [d: Doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. ] [b: You mean one has never been reported. ] 
    b: ([~yes ~no ] ) But you can hardly trust the media whether they do or don't report something. 
    d: ([impossible "can not" ] ) People say things are impossible, until someone else does them. 

# WON'T (WILL NOT)
u: WILLNOT1 (you < * will * not < !~qwords ) [Probably not. ] [I might reconsider. ] [b: You think I should change my mind? ] [d: I won't? ] [Maybe I will anyway. ]

    d: (~yes ) You contradict yourself. 
u: WILLNOT2 (I  * will not < !~qwords ) [b: You won't? ] [Maybe you will anyway. ] [d: Why won't you? ] [f: Would you reconsider? ] [f: What would it take to get you to change your mind? ] [So be it. ] [Too bad. ] 
    b: (will < * not ) I wish you would. 
    d: (because ) That's not much of a reason. 
    f: (~no ) I guess that means you really won't. 
    f: (~yes ) So what does it take to get you to change your mind?

u: (do not avoid the question ) [b: Isn't that what questions are for? ] [Why not? ] [Is there a penalty for missed answers? ]

    b: (both ) That covers it pretty thoroughly. 
    b: (neither ) Hey. You said you can't. Now you are disclaiming that? 
u: CANTI (you < * can < * not < !~qwords ) [I can't? ] [Maybe I can. ] [b: Do you really mean I shouldn't or that I am incapable of it? ] 
    b: (should ) Who says I shouldn't?
