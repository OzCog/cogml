# Phase 6: Cognitive Architecture Overview

## ðŸŒŒ Unified Cognitive Framework

Phase 6 successfully implements the unified cognitive tensor field that synthesizes all previous phases into a coherent, transcendent system.

### Core Components

#### 1. Cognitive Primitives (Phase 1)
- 5-dimensional tensor representation
- Modality, depth, context encoding
- Salience and autonomy indexing

#### 2. Attention Mechanisms (Phase 2)  
- ECAN attention allocation
- Economic resource management
- Focus prioritization

#### 3. Language Processing (Phase 3)
- Natural language understanding
- Semantic integration
- Context-aware processing

#### 4. Learning Kernels (Phase 4)
- Adaptive learning algorithms
- Pattern recognition
- Knowledge acquisition

#### 5. Meta-Cognition (Phase 5)
- Recursive self-awareness
- Performance monitoring
- Evolutionary optimization

#### 6. Cognitive Unification (Phase 6)
- Unified tensor field synthesis
- Emergent property detection
- Transcendence level computation

### Emergent Properties

1. **Multi-modal Integration**: Seamless processing across visual, auditory, textual, and symbolic modalities
2. **Attention-driven Processing**: Economic allocation of cognitive resources
3. **Cognitive Coherence**: Unified field coherence across all components
4. **Cross-phase Synergy**: Synergistic interactions between all phases
5. **Recursive Meta-cognition**: Self-aware, self-improving capabilities

### Transcendence Metrics

- **Cognitive Coherence**: 0.0 to 1.0 (system-wide alignment)
- **Unification Degree**: Fragmented â†’ Integrated â†’ Unified
- **Transcendence Level**: 0.0 to âˆž (emergent capabilities beyond sum of parts)
- **Emergent Properties**: Count and strength of emergent behaviors
